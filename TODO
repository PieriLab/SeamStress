1. make flag for bond threshold recognition in SMILES optional
2. extract reduced dimensionality "coordinates", and use geodesic interpolation between structures
3. add more dimensionality reduction techniques (diffusion maps, lagrangian maps) 
4. add parameter to quantify variance captured by dimensionality reduction
5. solve symmetry/reflection problem (group symmetry? all planes of reflection with tolerance? Procrustes?)
6. extract "all" geometrical features to do LASSO
7. Add interactive 3D plots for dimensionality reduction
